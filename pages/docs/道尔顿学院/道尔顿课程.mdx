# Graduation Tracks:
Starting in Senior 2, Dalton students select a “track”, or a focus to their program. This track will appear on their transcripts when applying to university. Tracks are a formal acknowledgement that students have taken a certain number of elective courses in a particular subject area, and are designed to aid students who would like to apply to major in related areas in university.
# Higher Level (HL) Courses and GPA

Higher level courses are not intended nor available to all students.  These courses offer university level content and rigor and are only available to students who meet the pre-requisites (demonstrated mastery in basic content and skills in previous courses).  Higher level courses carry a premium GPA (course weighting 5.0) and reward our most capable students for stretching themselves further with their course selections.

# College Counselling and Individual Learning Plans
BDFZ College Counseling Department provides personalized support for students and their families throughout the Dalton experience.  Our goals are to ensure that (1) each student becomes ‘extraordinary’ through the courses they select and the activities in which they engage, (2) that students’ profiles/portfolios reflect their learning journey, (3) that applications to universities are received in the best light possible and issues raised at time of application are dealt with positively and timely.
3 Year Counseling Plan
Senior 1 (S1):  Our focus in Senior 1 is the successful transition into high school. Transitioning to high school includes: dealing with new courses, new peers, new teachers, new activities, new environment, and with everything else new. Senior 1 student meet with their designated mentor on a monthly basis.  Students discuss their vocational, academic, and personal interests. The mentors help students become familiar with graduation requirements, advise in course selections, activity selections, and the development of SMART goals. These monthly meetings provide S1 students an opportunity to reflect on their performance, recognize opportunities, understand their strengths/challenges, and receive additional support. Each meeting is recorded on Chalk system or a similar platform. Students are encouraged to reach out for additional support when experiencing academic difficulties, social or emotional difficulties.  Mentors meet with counselors, parents, and teachers to discuss the student progress and to gather resources used in building and supporting the student profile and individual education plan.  Mentors meet with counselors at least once  a month to discuss trends and student cases.. There is a committee (including admin, department chairs and teachers) to which students in extraordinary circumstances are referred.  Just prior to CARP week (early May) , a revised Course Calendar (for the next academic year) will be published  along with video introductions for Senior 2 elective courses.  These documents inform discussion among students and parents regarding individual strengths, weaknesses and interests, possible graduation tracks and elective courses of interest.  During CARP week, students and parents are invited to attend presentations as well as question and answer sessions with Department Chairs and faculty members regarding elective courses and possible Independent Research topics connected to each subject.  At the end of CARP week, students will sit with College Counselors and Mentors to make their course selections for the next academic year.

Senior 2 (S2):  Our focus in Senior 2 students is the continuation of the student profile.  There should be growth and expanded interests in and outside of the school. S2 is the year that most students begin to become ‘EXTRAORDINARY’ through their Dalton experience.  S2 students meet with their mentor on a regular basis continuing similar conversations about their academic, personal, and vocational interests. At this time, S2 students can make modifications to their plans, get help with course selection, activity selection, adjust their SMART goals while mentors will keep an open-mind with supporting student’s interests and suggesting possible resources in and outside of school. S2 students attend more university fairs, college visits, student panels, alumni talks, career days, and conduct college research with the help of a mentor and counselor. All conversations are documented as part of the student study plan and we remind everyone to please reach out, early, for additional academic, social and/or emotional support.  Many students complete standardized tests during the S2 year. We advise students on the ‘best match’ from standardized tests available and recommend a single retake only (if necessary).  There are advantages to taking certain tests over others depending on individual student’s strengths. Mentors continue to meet with counselors at least once a month to discuss trends and student cases. Mentors update the Committee on students in unique/extraordinary circumstances who require different types of interventions.  During the second semester, students stop meeting with Mentors and instead begin meeting weekly with their assigned college counselor to discuss their plans and SMART goals. Counselors coach students through development of a long-list of target colleges, introduce a number of university matching tools, the CIALFO application system, offer a variety of workshops and introduce other platforms that students need to learn for their application process. During CARP week (early May) students and College Counselors review the student profile and check to ensure students are making progress and following the plan.  Action plans are created when students are found to be off track, or falling behind.  These action plans my include Dalton coursework, outside tests, or experiences (internships, service) that will help distinguish the student’s application to specific universities and programs.

Senior 3 (S3):  Our focus in S3 is the university application process.  S3 students dive deeper into the university research to create a shortlist of target colleges with their counselors. Counselors share university contacts, connect students with alumni, and current students. College counselors invite students to act as ambassadors when colleges of interest visit the Dalton campus.  Students and counselors keep all data including test scores, activity list, college list and plans up to date using Chalk and CIALFO. Letters of recommendations are requested in early fall and counselors obtain a list of deadline dates from their students. Although counselors help students with the application process, all work and essays are completed by students. Counselors submit transcripts directly to institutions only and at no time, do they provide information to third party organizations and at no time should official transcripts be obtained by students.

Upon receiving acceptances, counselors assist students in communicating with all target schools – the school accepted and the others declined – in paying required deposits and in applying for the appropriate student visa. BDFZ counselors also provide a transitions course to better prepare students for going abroad covering topics in Health, financial awareness, where to seek support, and visa preparation. Exit interviews will be conducted with each graduate in order to collect valuable data regarding matriculation and program of study.


# Cross-Cultural Literacy and Analysis Department(CLA)
The Cross-Cultural Literacy and Analysis Department (CLA) offers core and elective courses in Chinese language, literature, and culture regarding premodern and contemporary China.

黄晓鹃
作为CLA学科文化方向的选修课程，本课程除了介绍中国艺术史的基本研究方法和主要理论视角，也会带领大家着重探究不同时期的重要视觉艺术作品，既关注艺术品通过媒材、形式及母题所表现的物质特性，也致力于还原和重建艺术品所处的原初历史文化情境。此外，不同于一般意义上的通史课程，本课程更强调从全球艺术史的视角来理解中国古代艺术。
在欧美学术界和大众文化中，“中国艺术（Chinese Art）”一词作为一个特定的概念，实际上仅仅在19世纪的欧洲和北美才开始得到广泛的认可和使用。在这个主要以艺术品的材质和形式来分类和研究的“中国艺术传统”中，中国与“西方艺术传统”的差异被无可避免地突出甚至是放大了。在 20 世纪初期之后，随着中外交流的进一步深化，这种“西方中心”的中国艺术观又转而影响了本土艺术界和思想文化界人士对于 “何谓中国艺术”的认识和理解。得益于社会建构、后殖民主义和全球史的研究视角，当今的艺术史研究者基本可以达成以下共识：由于不同文明、不同地域、不同民族和不同时期中，艺术诞生的语境完全不同，艺术史研究入门也很难采用统一的方法和路径。本课程并非通常意义上的只关注名家名作的艺术史课程，而是会从什么是“中国艺术”这一看似简单的问题出发，鼓励学生打破习见的思维定势，尝试去理解视觉图像背后的社会文化历史脉络。
鉴于中国艺术史实际上涵盖了相当大的范畴，时间上的跨度也超过了七千年，从新石器时代的制陶和玉器文化一直延伸到在当代国际艺术界颇为有影响的影像、装置和行为艺术。本课程依据历史时代和主题分为前后衔接而又各自独立的两部分，第一部分的主题是“考古与物质文化”，主要关注从新石器时期晚期到 10 世纪以前的中国艺术与文化。第二部分的主题是“图像与视觉文化”，主要关注10世纪到20世纪的中国艺术与文化。
经过本课程的学习后，学生应能够：从整体上了解和认知古代中国的物质文化和视觉文化；学习如何体验和细致地分析重要的视觉艺术作品；认识到中国艺术创作和艺术品流通的多元社会文化背景；了解中国艺术研究领域的多元化和动态性，初步理解主要的研究理论和视角；认识到古代艺术文化的延续性和生命力，通过策展以及设计文创产品等活动来再现自己对中国古代物质文化和视觉文化的理解、诠释与现代转译。

	 ## 	ELA 3 A Glimpse into the Autistic Mind 
	Grade 	Senior 3 
	Semester 	Spring 
	Pre-requisite 	None 
	Instructor 	Li Xuezhen 
	Objectives 	If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave by Temple Grandin, a renowned scientist and autism advocate. Autism has been a mystery for the public with prevalent scary portrayals. Thanks to the ongoing research discoveries, a deeper understanding of developmental diversity has been achieved. Social and educational inclusion models have been developed and implemented. 
Our focus is to fully experience the inner world of people with autism by reading an autism book closely and analyzing the main characters. To better understand the spectrum, we will also examine the character Temple Grandin in the movie and in her real-life speeches. With the inspiration of the UN’s Autism Awareness Day on 2nd April, the students will design some impactful mini-projects to raise the community’s awareness of autism and enhance developmental diversity and inclusion. In this course, students will
 -	examine the texts closely to identify literary devices used, such as voice and tone, figures of speech, and imagery, for the purpose of contrasting the taken-for-granted perception of “being normal”.
 -	analyze the main character of the book, Christopher, especially where he demonstrates sensory overload, restricted interest, impairment in social interaction for not being able to naturally identify others’ body languages to interpret emotion and intention.
 -	discuss “superstition” a compensatory strategy Christopher used to combat his anxiety.
 -	be involved with a variety of activities, such as creating role-play/drama, organizing events on a continuum line, answering and devising quizzes and survey, rewriting dialogues, and assembling a Museum of Old Belief for Christopher to visualize his personal growth, and creating individual or groups projects to make impact.

Instructor 	Maria Pia Olivari Aeschlimann
Art is not only a creative expression, but also the forming of something pleasing to the eyes, ears, and minds of people.
Art can also be, as this course will show, used to challenge our understanding of the world in which we live and our roles in it.
Art has the social function of making us think about what is really going on in the world. Artists can use art to reflect, translate, and facilitate the understanding of diverse social issues, like racial and gender equality,
civil rights, sexual politics, cultural and social identity, and more. In this course, we will focus on understanding how art can help to implement or promote change, how it can enlighten people about specific problems or issues, and how it can appeal to their sense of justice.
We will do this through the analysis of different forms of art (paintings, music, literature, etc.).

Grade 	Senior 1&2&3
Semester 	Fall
Pre-requisite 	ELA 1
Instructor 	Chen Linling
Description 	The Sound and The Fury is a masterpiece by William Faulkner, who won Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. This course explores how the author successfully tells a story four times while readers do not feel redundancy. This experimental effect is made possible by using multiple narrative perspectives. Through the perspectives of a grown-up idiot, a suicidal Harvard University student, a failed businessperson, and a heartwarming black servant, four narrator’s struggles with their family’s collapse vividly unfold.

Students are encouraged to keep a writing journal as the story progresses. Through group work, students need to watch a film adopted from the novel and try to dub part of the film of their choice. Students also need to work in groups to do research on American social changes, especially about gender, race, and technology in the 1920s, then they present their findings in
the form of a poster. The class also includes fun activities such as contests about characters’ name or timeline of the story, and creative writing practices such as rewriting stories using perspectives from another gender, race, or social class.

We will be tracing the political developments leading to modern state formation, philosophical and religious beliefs that helped to shape how people tried to make sense of the world and their place in it, analyzing works of art and literature that were admired at the time, and mapping scientific and technological advancement. The course will be observing how various civilizations were confronted with and attempted to overcome challenges that we would still recognize today; the devastating impact of disease and plague, the fluctuations of a changing economy, challenges to tradition in the face of new ideas, political instability and the threat of war. This time period is often seen as being characterized solely by instability, calamity, and intellectual stagnation. Our aim is to challenge that assertion by engaging with the vast body of work that stands as a testament to human creativity, ingenuity, and the persistent longing to envision the world anew. 
Objectives 	- 	Students will learn to critique artistic representations of the medieval world - 	Students will gain critical skills for understanding primary resource documents - 	Students will evaluate the impact of religious and philosophical ideas - 	Students will begin to develop the basic research skills necessary for historical analysis - 	Students will generate discussions on competing interpretations of historical events

Semester 	Fall 2022 / Spring 2023 
Pre-requisite 	WCC 
Instructor 	James Vaughan 
Description 	This course will explore the root causes of human violent behavior from a variety of perspectives.

## 	Madness in Civilization 
Grade 	S2 & S3 
Semester 	Fall 2022 / Spring 2023 
Pre-requisite 	WCC 
Instructor 	James Vaughan 
Description 	From the perspective of medical anthropology, we will be looking deep into the impact culture has on shaping our ideas about illness and its treatment. This will be coupled with a historical approach as we see how the conceptions of “normal” and “abnormal”, “madness” and “sanity” change over time and in different areas of the world. From here we will then begin to investigate some of the more common mental disorders, namely, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, dissociative identity disorder, and PTSD. To gain a more complex understanding of these various disorders the class uses a multidisciplinary approach. For each disorder we will be consulting the DSM-5 manual to become familiar with the diagnostic criteria that is most commonly used today. We will then look at what the discipline of psychology has to say about each of these disorders and compare that to firsthand accounts given by people who have lived with, suffered through and have either successfully recovered from these disorders or continued to live meaningful lives despite them. We will also be looking at cultural representations of these various disorders such as, art, literature, music, and film to get a better understanding of how mental illness is commonly communicated to and understood by the general public.  
Objectives 	-	Students will be able to identify the social and cultural forces that shape how mental illness is constructed - 	Students will be able to distinguish between a variety of mental disorders using diagnostic criteria 
-	Students will be able to construct persuasive arguments critiquing and/or supporting various treatment methods designed to address mental health disorders

Pre-requisite 	WCC 
Instructor 	Justin Brown 
Description 	A life worth living is worth living well, but what does it mean to “live well”? It is a question that has been asked by the greatest minds throughout history the world over, but it can only be answered by each of us as individuals. We are all made to answer this question in some form with every decision we make every day. What will I eat for lunch? How will I travel to school today? How will I react to this situation? Being mindful of this allows us to live a purposeful, fulfilling life. In this class, we will examine perspectives ranging from Plato to Rousseau, Lao Zi to Locke, in order to provide a framework for each of us to build our personal ethos. Selected readings detailing different points of view on this subject followed by peer-led discussions will form the foundation of this course. From there, we will begin asking how to apply our beliefs to our everyday lives. Ultimately, students will be asked to provide a personal statement outlining their most fundamental belief and how it can be applied in their day to day lives. The goal is not to live by someone else’s understanding of how we should live, but to understand how we live, why we live that way, and apply consistent action to our behavior according to what we discover about ourselves. 
Objectives 	•	Evaluate the works of philosophers on the subject of ethics throughout history around the world 
•	Discuss the faults and strengths of a wide variety of approaches to the topic

## 	The Aging Brain at the End of the World: Human Society and Senile Dementia
Grade 	Senior 2&3
Semester 	2023 Spring
Pre-requisite 	S1 Full year biology or chemistry/S2 one semester of third science biology or chemistry
Instructor 	Zou Peizhu, Zhang Xinwen (Zhang Weibo)
Description 	This course is designed for students interested in interdisciplinary study of neurological disease, and the course will also touch on related theories of psychology and social science. Leading themes include (1) aging and (2) neurodegenerative diseases.
This course blends the learning of findings in neuroscience with the practice of science research strategy, biotechnologies, bioinformatic tools, and other abilities such as group working skills and critical thinking skills. Students will lay a foundation of basic neurobiology facts, discuss population aging, gain an insight of the biological nature of neurodegenerative diseases, and follow simplified research of a neurodegenerative disease from various perspectives including neurobiology, psychology and other perspectives that students themselves are interested. The final project of this course will continue for two weeks, involving an in-school exhibition of major topics that we will have covered in the lessons and a series of Dalton Rock Talk. Potential topics include: the predicaments of neurodegenerative diseases, the community based support for neurodegenerative diseases patients, and so on.

Objectives 	After taking the course, students will be able to:
•	Understand the basic facts of Brain.
•	Discuss and create an urban project to attempt to address population aging issue.
•	Analyze biology data applying GEO analysis and other bioinformatic tools.
•	Form a research proposal for a relatively new topic, the predicament of neurodegenerative disease.
•	Summarize the results of each project in a written and/or oral presentation.
