# Student Responsibilities
## Being a Responsible Student
Being a responsible student means more than following your teacher’s directions and receiving high marks on your class assignments. It means showing respect to others, even if you don’t agree with their ideas. It means treating people as you would like to be treated. It means taking the personal responsibility to be honest and ethical with all that you do. Dalton Academy encourages all students to:
Leave mobile devices turned off and put away during class, school meetings, and assemblies;
Keep food and drink in the cafeteria or other designated eating spaces;
Keep study and living spaces clean and healthy;
Treat other students, faculty and staff members politely and with respect;
Be active listeners when others are speaking;
Respond to email and other electronic communications from faculty in a timely manner;
Hand in all homework and assignments on time;
Attend all classes and show up on time;
Be honest when studying, taking tests, writing, and conducting research;
Maintain appropriate relations with peers, and behave in a mature and responsible manner;
Prioritize Dalton Academy work over outside work.
## Classroom Expectations

Students are expected to behave in class in accordance with the guidelines established by their teacher at the start of the course. This may include restrictions on the use of laptops and mobile communications devices. Students are expected to be attentive in the classroom. They should be active and respectful participants. No food or drink (except for water) may be brought into the classroom. Students must clean up their own messes when they leave the classroom. In addition, students may be asked by their teacher to clean the classroom at the beginning or end of class.


## Behavior in Open Spaces
Students should be respectful of the public student spaces on the 5th and 6th floors. When studying in these spaces, students must abide by all posted regulations. Students are only permitted to eat in designated food spaces. They must clean up after themselves, putting their garbage and recycling in their appropriate places. In addition, students do not have assigned seating, nor are they allowed to assign themselves seating. This means that all students have equal access to all public spaces. Bags, coats, books, or other property will be confiscated if left out. Repeated offences by the same student, may result in disciplinary action.

## Using Social Media Responsibly
How students conduct themselves online and on social media is an important part of behaving responsibly. Students need to be aware that anything they post on their social media is a public representation of their opinions and values. Negative posts about the school and faculty, about other students, or about China, can have serious repercussions on students’ current and future success. Students who have a problem with a particular school policy, the grade they receive in a course, or any other school-related criticism should take their criticism directly to the person involved. School mentors, college counsellors, the student development coordinator, and the curriculum development coordinators are always willing to speak with students about any concerns they may have.

## Time Management
Finding the time to get everything done can be a challenge. Students are encouraged to use a scheduling system (like a digital planner or a date book) to help organize and schedule their study time and other commitments. Weekly preview and review of course concepts are important ways for students to maintain a steady pace, and to avoid getting bogged down during busy times in the semester. Students who are having a hard time managing their time should speak with their mentor about how they can better manage their time.

## Disciplinary Action
Students who repeatedly demonstrate an inability to behave as a responsible student may find themselves facing disciplinary action. Students will be asked to meet with their mentors, the student development coordinator or the Head of Dalton to discuss the situation. The student’s parents may be asked to join the conversation, to help facilitate communication. Depending on the nature and severity of the behavior, Dalton Academy will give students a remedy chance and report to the Department of Student Affairs of BDFZ. According to the Student Handbook of BDFZ, the Department of Student Affairs of BDFZ will take disciplinary action against the students from "Warning" to "Expulsion" depending on the severity of the situation.

# 学术诚信-Academic Honesty
Academic integrity is vital to the pursuit of knowledge. Students are expected to submit their own work based on factual and clearly identified sources or data. Students should understand that tests, papers, projects, and other types of assessment are primarily designed to track their progress in skill building and engaging with the main topics discussed in their classes. Therefore, it is essential that students rely on their own efforts and do their best to ensure the integrity of all assessments. Violation of the Academic Honesty Code is a serious offense.

No student shall lie, cheat or seek unfair advantage in connection with his or her schoolwork, nor shall he or she tolerate other students who do so. This applies to all students enrolled in Dalton Academy, whether doing their coursework at Dalton, main school classes, or work outside of school.

Academically honest work should value the following principles:

Originality: students should submit original work that they have created themselves. References to the work of others needs to use a proper citation system. Students should submit new work for each class or project.
Inclusivity: all participants should be acknowledged when doing group work.
Accuracy: Information from other sources or a student’s own research needs to be evidence-based, not falsified or fabricated.
Examination Integrity: Students must follow the rules teachers set related to exam procedures.


If a student violates any one of the four principles, the student may be required to redo the assignment or may lose credit for the entirety of the assignment, the quiz, the project, etc. In more serious cases, the teacher is able to give the student an “F” in the course, the student will be required to retake the class if required for graduation. The case will also be reported to the Department of Student Affairs of BDFZ by which a disciplinary action will be taken against the students violating the Academic Honesty Code.

Repeated, serious offenses or deliberate, egregious offenses that undermine the integrity of education and evaluation of students at Dalton Academy will lead to dismissal from the school. Teachers in each class must provide guidance on what criteria need to be met in their classes to uphold Academic honesty.

Grading Appeals Process

It is important for students to take responsibility for their own learning; and it is therefore important they are in charge of this process. When studying abroad, students will not have the opportunity to have their parents speak with teachers on their behalf, so it is vital that Dalton Academy students learn a respectful and appropriate way to appeal their grades.

Before challenging a grade, students should be mindful of the Dalton Academy grading standards. They also need to review their course syllabus, so that they can speak intelligently about the grading standards for the particular course they are seeking to appeal. When speaking with teachers about their grades, students need to be polite and respectful. Students with poor attitudes will not be allowed to complete this process. Grades can be appealed at the end of the semester. Notification about grading appeals will be sent to all students via BDFZ academic office.

Students unhappy with a grade may follow a specific process for challenging their grade:

Communicate with teacher about class performance to receive feedback.
If still unhappy after meeting with teacher, then complete a Grading Appeal Application via Chalk.
The Grading Appeal Application is sent to the department chair and the head of school for consideration.
If there is sufficient reason, a meeting will be arranged with the student and the department chair to discuss the grade.

# 课程框架-Course Overview
## Core Courses

All Dalton Academy core courses are required for graduation and provide the foundation of our school’s curriculum. These courses include:

### English Liberal Arts

The English Liberal Arts department offers courses in literature, language, and writing. The core class in Senior 1-3 fosters confidence and autonomy in literary analysis and composition.

### Chinese Liberal Arts

The Chinese Liberal Arts department aims primarily to develop students' cross-cultural thinking, analysis, and communication skills. The CLA core course, also known as Cross-Cultural Literacy and Analysis, is a compulsory course for all S1 students.

### Global Studies

Global Studies offers multidisciplinary courses that analyze the interconnections between states, societies, economies, and cultures throughout the world. The core course is World Cultures and Civilizations.

### Mathematics

At Dalton, the math course offering is featured by differentiation, variety and flexibility. Most Senior 1 students start out in Advanced Algebra.

### Science

The Science Department at Dalton Academy supports students’ understanding of natural phenomena by offering students a thoughtful, thorough, and inspiring introduction to the key concepts and skills fundamental to practice in the field of science.

## Elective Courses

Elective courses are also required for graduation. Students have the freedom to select the type of elective courses they want, based on personal interest and study plan. These courses may fill certain requirements in the sciences, mathematics, liberal arts, or social sciences.

## Tracks: Liberal Arts, Science, and Global Studies

Starting in Senior 2, Dalton students select a “track”, or a focus to their program. This track will appear on their transcripts when applying to university. Tracks are a formal acknowledgement that students have taken a certain number of elective courses in a particular subject area.

## Geography, History, and Politics

All Chinese high school students are required to take courses in Chinese politics, history, and geography. These courses are offered by the main school at The Affiliated High School of Peking University.

## Experiential Learning Program (ELP)

ELP is Dalton’s unique program focusing on building up a bridge connecting classrooms and outside world, to help students to apply the theory and academic content to real-world experiences or to explore new knowledge beyond the class.

## Independent Research Program (IRP)

The Dalton Academy Independent Research Program provides one of the core experiences of a Dalton education. During each of the Senior 2 year all students are required to complete an Independent Research Project (IRP) with the support of a faculty research supervisor and in-class equipping in fundamental research and academic writing skills.

## Teaching Assistants (TA) and Student Teaching
Upper Senior student who have demonstrated mastery of course material may volunteer to aid the learning of his or her classmates. Some Dalton students who have shown tremendous interest or dedication in one particular field may work with a teacher to create an elective course.


# 课程评价-GPA scale

## How are students graded?

Dalton Academy places importance on learning outcomes and the learning process. Students are graded on the outcomes of their learning, such as how well they understand and can apply concepts from class. They are also graded on how they reach those outcomes. Participation, self-reflection, and academic honesty are central to a student’s learning journey. Students are graded based on individual performance, not through comparison with other students. The method each teacher uses to evaluate, will be outlined clearly in each class syllabus.

### An “A” Grade: Outstanding to Excellent

Students who receive an A grade exceed expectations. They have a positive attitude and participate in every class. They have a deep understanding of the class content and can apply this knowledge in innovative ways. All assignments are excellent and handed in on time. These students attend all of their classes.

### A “B” Grade: Very Good to Good

Students who receive a B grade meet expectations. They have a positive attitude and often participate. They understand the class content and can usually apply these concepts successfully. Homework and assignments are done well and handed in on time. These students do not miss classes or make up work from missed classes in a timely manner.

### A “C” Grade: Satisfactory to Below Satisfactory

Students who receive a C grade barely meet expectations. They may have trouble participating in a way that contributes meaningful to the class. With support, they are able to understand class content, but they may have difficulties applying these concepts. These students may have difficulties handing in all work on time, and may not complete all their homework. These students may be habitually late, or have unexcused absences.

### A “D” Grade: Serious Difficulties

Students who receive a D grade do not meet expectations. They do not often participate, are disrespectful in class, or otherwise have a bad attitude. There is little evidence of understanding class content. They may also have difficulties understanding academic honesty. These students do not take personal responsibility to learn. They may have serious attendance problems.

### An “F” Grade: Fail

Students who receive an F grade meet 1 of the following 3 criterion:

1) Willingly commit academic dishonest behavior.
2) Consistently demonstrate an unwillingness to perform adequately in the class.
3) Miss 1/3rd or more classes, misses important test dates, or do not hand in major assignments on time.

Teachers should communicate with the mentor, the student development coordinator as early as possible about the student receiving an “F”. Students who receive an “F” may have the opportunity to retake the course the following year, assuming the course is available to be taken, thereby hiding the original “F” on their transcript. Students who fail required courses, are required to retake the next year.

## Failing Courses and Tripartite Conversation

Dalton Academy offers rigorous curriculum that some students may feel extremely challenging. Students showing worrying signs of failing or being at risk will receive customized assistance from school upon meeting any of the following conditions:

- Having three or more "at-risk student" reports in the same month from core senior 1 classes (ELA, CLA, WCC, Math, Science).
- Having a "at-risk student" report at a month in ELA or IRP during senior 2&3.
- Having two or more "risk student" report either month in elective classes courses during senior 2&3
- Habitual or extreme violations of the “Being a Responsible Student” guidelines.
- Evidence of academic dishonesty.

A student who meets any of these conditions will be required to meet with their mentor, the student development coordinator, and their parents to address

| Grade                  | A+          | A         | B+        | B     | C+           | C                  | D                    | F    |

## 道尔顿国际部请假-Attendance

请假按照学校要求，统一在希悦系统请假，由高中教务批准或驳回。
在请假时，请学生务必第一时间联系缺课的相应的任课老师，通过邮件告知请假或缺课的原因，同时询问课程内容，以及与任课老师共同商讨错过的学习任务（如作业，presentation，测验等）的补救方法。
如果因为个人原因没有及时和任课老师沟通，而造成的过评分数的扣除，责任由学生个人承担。
基于国际部的方向的特殊性，其他请假相关建议如下：
### Class

Attendance and participation matter. Dalton Academy grading standards prioritize class participation. Parents will be notified of all class absences. In addition, course GPA will be lowered by one percentage point for each absence that is not approved. Students may seek approval for their absences on Chalk. Before seeking approval, students should contact their course teachers through email, seek approval to miss and reach an agreement on the missed assignments or grades. Students who miss a third or more classes from a particular course will automatically fail the course, regardless of whether the absences are approved or not. ​​​​​​​

### ELP/Field Trips

Experiential learning trips taking place during regularly scheduled times will not require special permission for leave. Students will automatically be granted approved absences, and these absences will not count towards their total amount of missed classes. Special field trips outside of the ELP program, should not interfere with other scheduled courses during the normal school days.

### Extra-Curricular Student Events

Students should minimize their number of absences from their classes due to extra-curricular events. Approval for leave will be accepted or denied based on an audit of the quality of the event, how many days will be missed, and whether the student has a plan for keeping up with class content missed.

### Health and Medical Appointments

Students should apply for leave for all medical appointments in advance. After the appointment, students should send a digital documentation of the appointment (e.g., receipt) to Chalk.

### Visa, Passport, or ID Card Meetings

Students should apply for leave for all visa, passport, and ID card appointments in advance. After the meeting, students should send digital documentation of the meeting to Chalk.



### Family or Personal Emergencies

Family or personal emergencies can be approved afterwards. Students should apply for leave within a week of returning to school.

### Medical Emergency or Illness

Students with a medical emergency or illness may seek leave approval within a week for returning to school. Students will be required to submit documentation of their illness. Students must submit either a dated receipt or note from a hospital/doctor, or a note from their parents with their parent’s contact information.

### Standardized Tests

Students are permitted to request leave to satisfy their university application test requirements. This includes TOEFL, SAT/ACT, and other tests required for the student’s particular application. To accommodate this requirement, students are asked to reduce the number of times they take a particular test, and to prioritize tests offered during vacations. Students must apply for leave before they leave. Late requests will not be approved. Approval is contingent on students providing proof that they took the test they requested leave for after they return from taking the test. This proof can be submitted digitally on chalk.

### Outside Classes, Test Prep and Tutoring

Students are forbidden from taking outside classes, including test preparation and private tutoring, during their regular scheduled class time.


## 支持体系Student Support

### Health and Safety

#### Emergency

If students are in class and experience an emergency, they should inform their teacher immediately. Once the teacher is aware of the situation, students should listen carefully to the teacher’s instructions and follow them carefully. If students experience an emergency situation outside of class, or if their teacher is otherwise unavailable, they should immediately contact the mentor.

In the case of a fire, students should quietly and quickly make their way through the emergency exit and into the school courtyard to await further instructions. Students should not leave campus, unless told to do so by a teacher.

#### Illness and Injury

If students are ill, injured or otherwise unable to attend classes, they need to have a family member accompany them to a doctor for treatment. A doctor’s note is required to excuse any absences.

If students are at school and become ill, they must contact their teacher before being excused. They can then contact a family member to pick them up to take them to see a doctor for treatment. If this is not possible, we also have a school nurse on campus who can be contacted (1009).

#### Stress and Depression

High school can be a challenging time for many students. The pressure from managing a busy schedule and expectations for success can create stress. New identities and relationships with other students, teachers, or parents can also lead to depression.

Students who are having a hard time are encouraged to speak with any of their teachers, mentors, or counselors about any difficulties they may be having. We also have a school psychologist, Dr. Qu, who is available to provide counseling for our students (1235).

Finally, we encourage students with any medical or psychological conditions that might affect their studies, to contact the mentor. This information will be kept private and only used to help students with their studies.

#### Bullying

Name-calling, physical abuse, aggressiveness, isolation, or other forms of mistreatment are all examples of bullying. Such acts are strongly discouraged. Students should treat their peers with kindness and respect, and refrain from negative treatment. Students who mistreat or bully other students, will be disciplined. Depending on the severity of the incident, students may be suspended from their classes or expelled from the school.

### Mentorship

The mentorship program is designed to support students during their Senior 1 and Senior 2 years at Dalton Academy. Students will be assigned mentors at the beginning of S1 year. Mentors will guide students through their academic lives at Dalton Academy. Mentors are Chinese faculty members who will meet with students biweekly. During mentorship, mentors will discuss a range of issues with their mentees, including: graduation requirements, school performance, time management, class attendance, academic planning, parent-child relations, mental health, etc. Mentors will regularly communicate with parents and subject teachers about mentees' school performance. Students who have any questions or meet any problems at Dalton Academy should first approach their mentors as a source of information and support.

### College Counseling

All students will also be guided by college counselors. Every student will be assigned to their designated college counselor from the beginning of their Senior 1, and that college counselor will accompany the students until they finish their college application and graduate.

College counselling services are provided throughout the three years in Dalton in order to support our students who plan on studying abroad. Every year, different senior classes will take college counseling courses with different focuses. Senior 1 course focuses on how to help students build the consciousness of studying abroad and future career. Senior 2 course is more about preparing different components for their college application. In Senior 3 course, students will be instructed with more hands-on college application skills and try their best to achieve their application goals.  Services include a variety of themes, such as Common Application, interviews, resume building, personal statement essay writing, and more! All students are mandatory to take college counseling courses for 3 years. The college center also provides individual meetings, advice in a variety of areas (such as improving the student profile, extra-curricular activities, college list preparation, personal essays), communication with universities, submission of documents and providing resources to assist a variety of student groups.

University and organization visits are hosted throughout the year to provide students an opportunity to learn about institutions, seasonal programs, research/extra-curricular opportunities, application processes, portfolio assistance and so on. Please note that we do not endorse any outside companies but provide meetings only to showcase possible options or guides for our students. Sometimes, we also collaborate with other schools in or outside of Beijing. Panel talks with current students, alumni, and other professionals provide networking opportunities.

In order to better support students and their families, the college center also hosts monthly parents meeting for each grade. All the information of studying abroad for students will be synchronized to their parents.

## Academic Research and the PKU Database
Research is an essential part of being a successful student at Dalton Academy and beyond. Students learn the process of how to conduct rigorous, academically honest research in their time here. One resource students have available for aiding with this process, is the Library Database of Peking University (PKU). While logged on to a PKU School internet connection on campus, students and faculty at the Affiliated High School of Peking University have access to a wealth of electronic academic resources through the Peking University Library Database. Electronic resources provided through the PKU Library Database can be sought and found in numerous Chinese databases and Western databases. As students and faculty at the Affiliated High School of Peking University, students have access to many of the same databases that PKU students and faculty enjoy, but not all of them.

Also, a greater number of Chinese and Western databases can be located on the PKU Library website, and accessed from a PKU School internet connection, without a login. There are also open access databases listed in the PKU Library Database. Those, as well as any other open access databases, can be accessed from any internet connection without a login. While searching for academic resources, students should be able to locate full-text books, articles and other media that can be download onto your computer or read online.

Also, a number of Chinese printed sources are available at the BDFZ Library, located on the third floor of the Main Building. This guide is a resource to direct students to as many electronic and printed publications possible to which they have access through Peking University so that they may locate all the academic sources that they need to carry out their academic writing.

Chinese http://www.lib.pku.edu.cn/portal/ English http://eng.lib.pku.edu.cn/

On the homepage, you will see links to several of the library’s features like its online library catalogs and e-resources. You can use the PKU Library’s online catalog to search for printed resources located at the PKU Library, at its branch libraries and collections, including the BDFZ library, which is located on the third floor of the Main Building. The PKU Library’s online catalog can be found on the following page:

http://162.105.138.200/uhtbin/cgisirsi/0/0/0/49. All of the databases to which Peking University has institutional access are listed in one location online. You may either select from a list of Western databases or a list of Chinese databases. The databases are listed on the following webpage:
