# Dalton Course List

**Dalton Course Calendar and Course Description Guide:**

This document is to be used by students, as a guide, while they make
course selections each year and progress toward graduation from Dalton
Academy.

Each student has a unique narrative built upon individual strengths and
interests, but most Dalton graduates' academic interests fall into
several broad categories (called TRACKS) , namely: Math, Business &
Economics, Engineering & Technology, Life Science, English, Social
Studies and the Fine Arts. Please review the graduation requirements -
compulsory and elective courses - for each of the subject-based profiles
identified in the table below.

Be sure to discuss with your Mentor and College Counselor the programs
that interest you most at your target universities. This document,
Mentors and College Counselors will help you make informed and correct
choices regarding subjects and levels.

Graduation Tracks:

Starting in Senior 2, Dalton students select a "track", or a focus to
their program. This track will appear on their transcripts when applying
to university. Tracks are a formal acknowledgement that students have
taken a certain number of elective courses in a particular subject area,
and are designed to aid students who would like to apply to major in
related areas in university.

Higher Level (HL) Courses and GPA

Higher level courses are not intended nor available to all students.
These courses offer university level content and rigor and are only
available to students who meet the pre-requisites (demonstrated mastery
in basic content and skills in previous courses). Higher level courses
carry a premium GPA (course weighting 5.0) and reward our most capable
students for stretching themselves further with their course selections.

College Counselling and Individual Learning Plans

BDFZ College Counseling Department provides personalized support for
students and their families throughout the Dalton experience. Our goals
are to ensure that (1) each student becomes 'extraordinary' through the
courses they select and the activities in which they engage, (2) that
students' profiles/portfolios reflect their learning journey, (3) that
applications to universities are received in the best light possible and
issues raised at time of application are dealt with positively and
timely.

**3 Year Counseling Plan**

Senior 1 (S1): Our focus in Senior 1 is the successful transition into
high school. Transitioning to high school includes: dealing with new
courses, new peers, new teachers, new activities, new environment, and
with everything else new. Senior 1 student meet with their designated
mentor on a monthly basis. Students discuss their vocational, academic,
and personal interests. The mentors help students become familiar with
graduation requirements, advise in course selections, activity
selections, and the development of SMART goals. These monthly meetings
provide S1 students an opportunity to reflect on their performance,
recognize opportunities, understand their strengths/challenges, and
receive additional support. Each meeting is recorded on Chalk system or
a similar platform. Students are encouraged to reach out for additional
support when experiencing academic difficulties, social or emotional
difficulties. Mentors meet with counselors, parents, and teachers to
discuss the student progress and to gather resources used in building
and supporting the student profile and individual education plan.
Mentors meet with counselors at least once a month to discuss trends and
student cases.. There is a committee (including admin, department chairs
and teachers) to which students in extraordinary circumstances are
referred. Just prior to CARP week (early May) , a revised Course
Calendar (for the next academic year) will be published along with video
introductions for Senior 2 elective courses. These documents inform
discussion among students and parents regarding individual strengths,
weaknesses and interests, possible graduation tracks and elective
courses of interest. During CARP week, students and parents are invited
to attend presentations as well as question and answer sessions with
Department Chairs and faculty members regarding elective courses and
possible Independent Research topics connected to each subject. At the
end of CARP week, students will sit with College Counselors and Mentors
to make their course selections for the next academic year.

Senior 2 (S2): Our focus in Senior 2 students is the continuation of the
student profile. There should be growth and expanded interests in and
outside of the school. S2 is the year that most students begin to become
'EXTRAORDINARY' through their Dalton experience. S2 students meet with
their mentor on a regular basis continuing similar conversations about
their academic, personal, and vocational interests. At this time, S2
students can make modifications to their plans, get help with course
selection, activity selection, adjust their SMART goals while mentors
will keep an open-mind with supporting student's interests and
suggesting possible resources in and outside of school. S2 students
attend more university fairs, college visits, student panels, alumni
talks, career days, and conduct college research with the help of a
mentor and counselor. All conversations are documented as part of the
student study plan and we remind everyone to please reach out, early,
for additional academic, social and/or emotional support. Many students
complete standardized tests during the S2 year. We advise students on
the 'best match' from standardized tests available and recommend a
single retake only (if necessary). There are advantages to taking
certain tests over others depending on individual student's strengths.
Mentors continue to meet with counselors at least once a month to
discuss trends and student cases. Mentors update the Committee on
students in unique/extraordinary circumstances who require different
types of interventions. During the second semester, students stop
meeting with Mentors and instead begin meeting weekly with their
assigned college counselor to discuss their plans and SMART goals.
Counselors coach students through development of a long-list of target
colleges, introduce a number of university matching tools, the CIALFO
application system, offer a variety of workshops and introduce other
platforms that students need to learn for their application process.
During CARP week (early May) students and College Counselors review the
student profile and check to ensure students are making progress and
following the plan. Action plans are created when students are found to
be off track, or falling behind. These action plans my include Dalton
coursework, outside tests, or experiences (internships, service) that
will help distinguish the student's application to specific universities
and programs.

Senior 3 (S3): Our focus in S3 is the university application process. S3
students dive deeper into the university research to create a shortlist
of target colleges with their counselors. Counselors share university
contacts, connect students with alumni, and current students. College
counselors invite students to act as ambassadors when colleges of
interest visit the Dalton campus. Students and counselors keep all data
including test scores, activity list, college list and plans up to date
using Chalk and CIALFO. Letters of recommendations are requested in
early fall and counselors obtain a list of deadline dates from their
students. Although counselors help students with the application
process, all work and essays are completed by students. Counselors
submit transcripts directly to institutions only and at no time, do they
provide information to third party organizations and at no time should
official transcripts be obtained by students.

Upon receiving acceptances, counselors assist students in communicating
with all target schools -- the school accepted and the others declined
-- in paying required deposits and in applying for the appropriate
student visa. BDFZ counselors also provide a transitions course to
better prepare students for going abroad covering topics in Health,
financial awareness, where to seek support, and visa preparation. Exit
interviews will be conducted with each graduate in order to collect
valuable data regarding matriculation and program of study.

| **Cross-Cultural Literacy and Analysis**                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The Cross-Cultural Literacy and Analysis Department (CLA) offers core
and elective courses in Chinese language, literature, and culture
regarding premodern and contemporary China. The core course specifically
designed for Senior 1 students adopts a project-based learning approach
to develop cultural competency as well as proficiency of Classical
Chinese, both needed for the students to understand and fully appreciate
Chinese literature and culture in an ever-changing global context.
Students can also choose from a variety of elective courses to further
develop their interests, sense of aesthetic, and analytical thinking
skill set.

The Independent Research Program (IRP) provides students with
opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary research projects in their
Senior 2 and Senior 3 years. Our aim is to help students develop
research skills while cultivating a critical thinking mindset. All the
students need to take IRP2 course in Senior 2. In Senior 3, students who
are dedicated to research can continue to take IRP3 HL to delve deeply
into a research topic and gain an upgraded training in academic
communication.

|          | Art）"一词作为一个特定的概念，实际上仅仅                  |
|          | 在19世纪的欧洲和北美才开始得到广泛的认可和使用。在这个主  |

|          | 由于不同文明、不同地域、不同民族和不同时期中，艺术诞生的  |

|        | students with the skills and outlook of researchers using   |
|        | project-based learning. Students will use the Senior 2 year |
|        | to explore a research field of interest aligned with        |
|        | corresponding elective courses they take and complete a     |

| **Descr  | Biology in Action is a semester long course with a focus  |
| iption** | on investigating current and important topics in Biology. |
|          | We will use a top down approach to identify the resources |
|          | and knowledge needed to better understand the topic. The  |
|          | goal is to help you go beyond simply gaining an           |
|          | understanding of the core concepts by developing a        |
|          | personal connection to the subject. This is a different   |
|          | approach to teaching and learning Biology, and therefore  |
|          | we will be exploring various forms of learning to         |
|          | investigate the different topics we encounter. The course |
|          | is a project based learning class, which means that we    |
|          | will have many short projects and activities that will    |
|          | require time both inside and outside of the classroom.    |
|          | Discussion, presentations, and writing (mostly informal)  |
|          | will be common practices throughout the class. We will    |
|          | also engage in scientific practices such as               |
|          | experimentation and modeling. Overall, by taking this     |
|          | course you should gain a deeper understanding of the      |
|          | subject and a sense of how you can apply Biology to your  |
|          | life.                                                     |

|          | -   Students will understand, explain and evaluate some   |
|          |     of the core concepts in Biology.                      |
|          |                                                           |
|          | -   Students will develop their ability to apply          |
|          |     knowledge of biology  Students will gain insight     |
|          |     into scientific practices.                            |
|          |                                                           |
|          | -   Students will cultivate skills in logical and         |
|          |     creative thinking.                                    |

| *       | Microbes the most abundant organisms in this planet. They  |
| *Descri | are not only surrounding us, but they are also on us and   |
| ption** | even within us! They can be pathogens, crop fertilizers    |
|         | and bioengineering tools. They influence us much stronger  |
|         | than we ever thought. But many of us know little about     |
|         | them. In this course, students are encouraged to ask       |
|         | microbiology-related questions originated from their life  |
|         | experiences. The course offers them a flexible research    |
|         | platform to explore and explain open questions like a real |
|         | microbiologist by doing scientific and engineering         |
|         | practices using disciplinary ideas, crosscutting concepts  |
|         | and professional skills they learnt from this course.      |

|          | The course will be built upon activities, presentations,  |
|          | and discussions related to the concepts we will address   |
|          |                                                           |
|          | throughout the semester. You will be given sections from  |
|          | several textbooks which will provide specific content     |
|          | knowledge needed for in class sessions. You will be       |
|          | expected to complete assigned readings in a timely        |
|          | manner, and regularly provide evidence of completing the  |
|          | readings through either the submission of notes or        |
|          | chapter discussions. We will have 2 major projects in the |
|          | course, where we will connect what we have learned in the |
|          | course to field research, these projects will be          |
|          | considered the formal assessments of the course instead   |
|          | of tests or quizzes. The first will be a guided research  |
|          | study in which you will be specific research question to  |
|          | investigate, and the second will be an open research      |
|          | study which you will decide upon your own research        |
|          | question. Both projects will be group projects, but you   |
|          | will have individual components to complete.              |

| **Descr  | Animal Behavior is a semester long elective course for    |
| iption** | Senior 2 and Senior 3 Dalton students. The overall        |
|          | objective of the course is to learn the core concepts and |
|          | practices of biological research through the field of     |
|          | Animal Behavior. The course will explore content such as: |
|          | the causes and consequences of behaviors including        |
|          | predation, foraging, migration, and mating behavior. The  |
|          | class has a project-based learning focus, with a strong   |
|          | emphasis on scientific research skills and communication. |
|          | Throughout the semester students will participate in      |
|          | designing and completing a research study                 |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|          | related to animal behavior in order to practice their     |
|          | research skills and learn from experience.                |
|          |                                                           |
|          | There are three typical class settings, which include:    |
|          | discussion/presentation, activity/lab work, and research  |
|          | project work. The objective of discussion/presentation is |
|          | to give students opportunities to understand the core     |
|          | concepts animal behavior and allow them to improve their  |
|          | speaking skills. Activity/lab work is intended to help    |
|          | students gain an understanding of the core concepts of    |
|          | scientific research and is useful for providing students  |
|          | a chance to apply their understanding of the content.     |
|          | Lastly, research project work is a core component of the  |
|          | class due to the time required to complete the project.   |
|          | During research project work time, students will gain an  |
|          | understanding of research practices, and can collaborate  |
|          | and receive guidance on their projects. This course is    |
|          | intended to provide students interested in pursuing       |

## Mathematics 

Mathematics is a fundamental part of a high school education. At Dalton,
the math course offering is featured by differentiation, variety and
flexibility. Most students start out in Advanced Algebra for the first
two semesters. Some students may be required to take Algebra before they
stretch themselves in the Finite Math and Its Application course in
their first semester of the second year. Some other students are
recommended to take Integrated Math HL as an accelerated track that
covers both full-year Advanced Algebra and PreCalculus in one year.

Once these introductory core courses are complete, students will choose
based on their intended program of study at university. Students from
Integrated Math HL who are interested in studying math, physics,
engineering and other science majors and who have proven their strong
mathematics background will take Calculus HL 1 and 2 as second-year
students upon approval. This path will open up many possibilities to
take other HL STEM electives in their last year of High School. Students
completing full-year Advanced Algebra can also choose Calculus SL in the
first semester. Students who have proven their math capabilities but who
choose the Liberal Arts or Global Studies tracks and who are interested
biology/chemistry major should challenge themselves with Statistics 1
and 2 in second year. Students who divert the interest after semester 1
of year 2 are allowed to switch to different courses, such as Game
Theory, Geometry upon approval.

|   |   | **D    |   | Statistics II is the second course in a two semester       |   |
|   |   | escrip |   | sequence. This sequence is an introductory college         |   |
|   |   | tion** |   | statistics course. In this sequence, students develop      |   |
|   |   |        |   | strategies for collecting, organizing, analyzing and       |   |
|   |   |        |   | drawing conclusions from data.                             |   |

|   |   |        |   | Students design, administer, and tabulate results from     |   |
|   |   |        |   | surveys and experiments. Probability and simulations aid   |   |
|   |   |        |   | students in constructing models for chance phenomena.      |   |
|   |   |        |   | Sampling distributions provide the logical structure for   |   |
|   |   |        |   | confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Students are    |   |
|   |   |        |   | advised to use a TI-Nspire calculator and computer based   |   |
|   |   |        |   | statistical software to investigate statistical concepts.  |   |
|   |   |        |   | To develop effective statistical communication skills,     |   |
|   |   |        |   | students are required to prepare frequent written and oral |   |
|   |   |        |   | analyses of real data. Students will also work in groups   |   |
|   |   |        |   | to complete projects based on real world statistical       |   |
|   |   |        |   | applications. Projects will require them to collect,       |   |
|   |   |        |   | analyze and interpret data.                                |   |

|   | **Objec | ***If by some magic, autism** had been eradicated from    |
|   | tives** | the face of the earth, then men would still be            |
|   |         | socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a  |
|   |         | cave* by Temple Grandin, a renowned scientist and autism  |
|   |         | advocate. Autism has been a mystery for the public with   |
|   |         | prevalent scary portrayals. Thanks to the ongoing         |
|   |         | research discoveries, a deeper understanding of           |
|   |         | developmental diversity has been achieved. Social and     |
|   |         | educational inclusion models have been developed and      |
|   |         | implemented.                                              |
|   |         |                                                           |
|   |         | Our focus is to fully experience the inner world of       |
|   |         | people with autism by reading an autism book closely and  |
|   |         | analyzing the main characters. To better understand the   |
|   |         | spectrum, we will also examine the character Temple       |
|   |         | Grandin in the movie and in her real-life speeches. With  |
|   |         | the inspiration of the UN's Autism Awareness Day on 2^nd^ |
|   |         | April, the students will design some impactful            |
|   |         | mini-projects to raise the community's awareness of       |
|   |         | autism and enhance developmental diversity and inclusion. |
|   |         | In this course, students will                             |
|   |         |                                                           |
|   |         | -   examine the texts closely to identify literary        |
|   |         |     devices used, such as voice and tone, figures of      |
|   |         |     speech, and imagery, for the purpose of contrasting   |
|   |         |     the taken-for-granted perception of "being normal".   |
|   |         |                                                           |
|   |         | -   analyze the main character of the book, Christopher,  |
|   |         |     especially where he demonstrates sensory overload,    |
|   |         |     restricted interest, impairment in social interaction |
|   |         |     for not being able to naturally identify others' body |
|   |         |     languages to interpret emotion and intention.         |
|   |         |                                                           |
|   |         | -   discuss "superstition" a compensatory strategy        |
|   |         |     Christopher used to combat his anxiety.               |
|   |         |                                                           |
|   |         | -   be involved with a variety of activities, such as     |
|   |         |     creating role-play/drama, organizing events on a      |
|   |         |     continuum line, answering and devising quizzes and    |
|   |         |     survey, rewriting dialogues, and assembling a Museum  |
|   |         |     of Old Belief for Christopher to visualize his        |
|   |         |     personal growth, and creating individual or groups    |
|   |         |     projects to make impact.                              |

| **Objec | This course will give students a chance to employ their    |
| tives** | existing skills in studying and considering the themes and |
|         | elements of Science Fiction on a deeper, insightful level. |
|         | Sci-Fi as a genre has always had the dual ability to       |
|         | provide escapism and reflection, its visions of future     |
|         | technology and human advancements echoing back to the real |
|         | world.                                                     |
|         |                                                            |
|         | Raising questions of ethics, identity, and consequence     |
|         | through the lens of imagined futures and realities.        |
|         |                                                            |
|         | Students will study iconic texts in literature             |
|         | (*Frankenstein, Left Hand of Darkness*) and film (*Blade   |
|         | Runner, 2001)*, as well as existing essays on the genre to |
|         | provide further insight. They will compare and contrast    |
|         | these texts in their own work, and consider them through   |
|         | the lens of several distinct topics that regularly appear  |
|         | in Sci-Fi. Examples could include identity, what it means  |
|         | to be human, corporate greed or the role of technology in  |
|         | human evolution.                                           |
|         |                                                            |
|         | A chance to look into these stories of dystopian futures,  |
|         | fantastical adventures and alien worlds, and understand    |
|         | them further. How do they relate to reality? What messages |
|         | and implications are they positing? What techniques appear |
|         | over both literature and film to help create these worlds  |
|         | and emphasise these points? And how do these techniques    |
|         | connect to, and distinguish from, each other? After taking |
|         | this course, students should be able to:                   |
|         |                                                            |
|         | -   Students will understand, explain and evaluate works   |
|         |     of nonfiction with the additional context of genre.    |
|         |                                                            |
|         | -   Students will further develop both written and verbal  |
|         |     communication skills.  Students will strengthen       |
|         |     skills in analytical thinking and reflective           |
|         |     discourse.                                             |
|         |                                                            |
|         | -   Students will develop analytical skills for both       |
|         |     literature and film texts, as well as how to           |
|         |     distinguish and compare the two.                       |
|         |                                                            |
|         | -   Students will develop a deeper understanding of the    |
|         |     topics and themes that can appear in science fiction   |
|         |     texts, as well as other genres/mediums, and how they   |
|         |     relate to society and the world as a whole.            |
|         |                                                            |
|         | -   Students will cultivate skills in crafting a variety   |
|         |     of engaging, academic and polished forms of writing.   |

| >       | This course will explore the depiction of travel in a      |
| **Objec | variety of texts, and challenge students to consider how   |
| tives** | traversed space is depicted and projected onto page and    |
|         | screen. Students will analyse a wide range of materials,   |
|         | from travel journalism to road trip movies to lonesome     |
|         | pilgrimages in video games. They will consider the skills  |
|         | and techniques being employed by others in these texts to  |
|         | share the experience of travel; be it personal, universal, |
|         | metaphorical and literal. For students preparing for       |
|         | travel themselves, experiencing different places and       |
|         | cultures, this course will provide a valuable insight into |
|         | the traveller's experience, and what it is to be someone   |
|         | moving through these spaces.                               |
|         |                                                            |
|         | Texts will cover iconic literature like *On the Road,*     |
|         | cinematic road trips such as *Motorcycle Diaries,* and the |
|         | possibilities of interactive travel as seen in games such  |
|         | as *Journey*. These will also be coupled with relative     |
|         | writing on theory and criticism in travel cinema and       |
|         | gaming.                                                    |

> Through analysing these texts, students will develop a better
> understanding of the tools needed not just for future education, but
> in their own literal and metaphorical travels, and how to channel them
> into creative projects.
>
> After taking this course, students will be able to:

-   Understand, explain and evaluate a variety of texts.

-   Understand and notice the similarities and differences between the
    mediums in question, and be further prepared for the
    interdisciplinary nature of some university modules.

-   Write skillful and informed analytical work on a variety of topics,
    as well as developing their own creative skills for their own
    original work.

-   Present and discuss their opinions with developed written and verbal
    communication skills.

|   | *       | While it is often said that history is written by the     |
|   | *Descri | victors, such histories are not necessarily reliable.     |
|   | ption** | With the decline of European empires and the process of   |
|   |         | decolonization, new voices emerged to challenge the       |
|   |         | stories told from colonial perspectives. This course will |
|   |         | study literature written in countries formerly colonized  |
|   |         | by European powers in reaction to colonization and its    |
|   |         | past and present effects, which is known as postcolonial  |
|   |         | literature. In this course, students will be introduced   |
|   |         | to the history of colonization, as well as key concepts   |
|   |         | of postcolonial studies through reading texts from        |
|   |         | important thinkers in the field, including Frantz Fanon,  |
|   |         | Edward Said, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Chinua Achebe. In         |
|   |         | addition, students will explore key themes and ideas in   |
|   |         | postcolonial literature through 3 main texts: *Things     |
|   |         | Fall Apart* by Chinua Achebe, *This Earth of Mankind* by  |
|   |         | Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and *Nervous Conditions* by Tsitsi |

| *       | Art is not only a creative expression, but also the        |
| *Descri | forming of something pleasing to the eyes, ears, and minds |
| ption** | of people. Art can also be, as this course will show, used |
|         | to challenge our understanding of the world in which we    |
|         | live and our roles in it. Art has the social function of   |
|         | making us think about what is really going on in the       |
|         | world. Artists can use art to reflect, translate, and      |
|         | facilitate the understanding of diverse social issues,     |
|         | like racial and gender equality, civil rights, sexual      |
|         | politics, cultural and social identity, and more. In this  |
|         | course, we will focus on understanding how art can help to |
|         | implement or promote change, how it can enlighten people   |
|         | about specific problems or issues, and how it can appeal   |
|         | to their sense of justice. We will do this through the     |
|         | analysis of different forms of art (paintings, music,      |
|         | literature, etc.). The driving questions of this course    |
|         | will be: how can art be a powerful and persuasive tool to  |
|         | shape the minds of people? How does art use rhetorical     |
|         | means to provide commentary on issues in a society?        |

| *       | Feminism has historically looked at how women have been    |
| *Descri | depicted or ignored in society. Feminist lenses are used   |
| ption** | to see how women have been missing from history, social    |
|         | science, literature, and other academic fields. In this    |
|         | course, we will focus on understanding how feminism and    |
|         | literature has helped empower women to not only find their |
|         | own voice, but also how it has been used to achieve        |
|         | fundamental rights for women. Through the analysis of      |
|         | different readings and complementary materials, we will    |
|         | analyze the path of women in literature to fully           |
|         | understand the present-day situation of women in the       |
|         | world. The driving questions for this course will be: How  |
|         | do feminist movements and literature complement each other |
|         | to empower women? How does feminism and literature help to |
|         | construct a reality where women have a voice and a key     |
|         | role to achieve fundamental women rights?                  |

| *       | *The Sound and The Fury* is a masterpiece by William       |
| *Descri | Faulkner, who won Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949. This |
| ption** | course explores how the author successfully tells a story  |
|         | four times while readers do not feel redundancy. This      |
|         | experimental effect is made possible by using multiple     |
|         | narrative perspectives. Through the perspectives of a      |
|         | grown-up idiot, a suicidal Harvard University student, a   |
|         | failed businessperson, and a heartwarming black servant,   |
|         | four narrator's struggles with their family's collapse     |
|         | vividly unfold.                                            |
|         |                                                            |
|         | In this course, students examine how multiple narrative    |
|         | perspectives not only offer an in-depth look into          |
|         | narrator's thoughts, actions, and motivation, but also     |
|         | create a broad panorama of the society narrators live in.  |
|         | Students are encouraged to keep a writing journal as the   |
|         | story progresses. Through group work, students need to     |
|         | watch a film adopted from the novel and try to dub part of |
|         | the film of their choice. Students also need to work in    |
|         | groups to do research on American social changes,          |
|         | especially about gender, race, and technology in the       |
|         | 1920s, then they present their findings in the form of a   |
|         | poster. The class also includes fun activities such as     |
|         | contests about characters' name or timeline of the story,  |
|         | and creative writing practices such as rewriting stories   |
|         | using perspectives from another gender, race, or social    |
|         | class. At the end of the course, students will have a firm |
|         | understanding of narrative perspectives and extend it to   |
|         | their future writing practices.                            |

| **Descr  | World Cultures and Civilizations is a year-long course    |
| iption** | that traces the major political organizations, societies, |
|          | and cultures that comprise human history. The essential   |
|          | questions for this course are: How have human societies   |
|          | organized themselves to create the most effective and     |
|          | beneficial mode of dealing with the challenges of settled |
|          | community living? How do communities use belief and       |
|          | culture to organize or reinforce power structures? The    |
|          | course will discuss how human organization has evolved    |
|          | over time to meet the various demands of the environment, |
|          | geography, and human needs. Throughout the course,        |
|          | students will grapple with what makes effective           |
|          | governmental and societal organization as well as the     |
|          | tradeoffs that societies have to make in their decisions. |
|          | This course will look at the case-studies of political    |
|          | and social power to have students better understand the   |
|          | ways in which power has been and can be organized with an |
|          | emphasis on how these problems are still present and      |
|          | relevant to governments and societies today. Throughout   |
|          | these case-studies, students will also become familiar    |
|          | with the belief systems and cultural ideas that develop   |
|          | to both 1) answer basic human questions of life, death,   |
|          | suffering, etc. and 2) help reinforce classes,            |
|          | government, or existing power structures.                 |

  **Course name**     The Ghosts of Revolution
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  **Grade**           S1

  **Semester**        Spring 2022

  **Pre-requisite**   None

  **Instructor**      James Vaughan

  **Description**     This course will focus on a number of revolutions that have
                      assisted in the ushering in of the modern world and how the
                      issues present at the moment of uprising continue to be
                      debated in the present. The course is centered around the
                      tracing of concepts like progress, race, gender, and class
                      through a number of time periods and regions around the
                      world to illustrate how the meaning and political
                      significance of these concepts change. In many ways the
                      revolutionary projects that were started centuries ago
                      remain unfinished, while others have been abandoned
                      altogether. We will try to seek an understanding as to why
                      certain ideas that rise to ascendency in one particular era
                      gradually diminish in their influence and either disappear
                      or reemerge once again. We will conclude by debating the
                      dominant ideas that seem to define the world we currently
                      live in.

  **Course name**     The Dark Ages Reimagined
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  **Grade**           S1

  **Semester**        Fall 2022

  **Pre-requisite**   None

  **Instructor**      James Vaughan

  **Description**     This course will focus on the cultural, philosophical, and
                      scientific achievements taking place between the collapse
                      of the Roman Empire and the historic voyage of Columbus. We
                      will be tracing the political developments leading to
                      modern state formation, philosophical and religious beliefs
                      that helped to shape how people tried to make sense of the
                      world and their place in it, analyzing works of art and
                      literature that were admired at the time, and mapping
                      scientific and technological advancement. The course will
                      be observing how various civilizations were confronted with
                      and attempted to overcome challenges that we would still
                      recognize today; the devastating impact of disease and
                      plague, the fluctuations of a changing economy, challenges
                      to tradition in the face of new ideas, political
                      instability and the threat of war. This time period is
                      often seen as being characterized solely by instability,
                      calamity, and intellectual stagnation. Our aim is to
                      challenge that assertion by engaging with the vast body of
                      work that stands as a testament to human creativity,
                      ingenuity, and the persistent longing to envision the world
                      anew.

  **Objectives**       Students will learn to critique artistic representations
                      of the medieval world  Students will gain critical skills
                      for understanding primary resource documents  Students
                      will evaluate the impact of religious and philosophical
                      ideas  Students will begin to develop the basic research
                      skills necessary for historical analysis  Students will
                      generate discussions on competing interpretations of
                      historical events

| **Descr  | From the perspective of medical anthropology, we will be  |
| iption** | looking deep into the impact culture has on shaping our   |
|          | ideas about illness and its treatment. This will be       |
|          | coupled with a historical approach as we see how the      |
|          | conceptions of "normal" and "abnormal", "madness" and     |
|          | "sanity" change over time and in different areas of the   |
|          | world. From here we will then begin to investigate some   |
|          | of the more common mental disorders, namely, depression,  |
|          | bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, dissociative    |
|          | identity disorder, and PTSD. To gain a more complex       |
|          | understanding of these various disorders the class uses a |
|          | multidisciplinary approach. For each disorder we will be  |
|          | consulting the DSM-5 manual to become familiar with the   |
|          | diagnostic criteria that is most commonly used today. We  |
|          | will then look at what the discipline of psychology has   |
|          | to say about each of these disorders and compare that to  |
|          | firsthand accounts given by people who have lived with,   |
|          | suffered through and have either successfully recovered   |
|          | from these disorders or continued to live meaningful      |
|          | lives despite them. We will also be looking at cultural   |
|          | representations of these various disorders such as, art,  |
|          | literature, music, and film to get a better understanding |
|          | of how mental illness is commonly communicated to and     |
|          | understood by the general public.                         |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Obje   | -   Students will be able to identify the social and      |
| ctives** |     cultural forces that shape how mental illness is      |
|          |     constructed  Students will be able to distinguish    |
|          |     between a variety of mental disorders using           |

|          | -   Students will be able to construct persuasive         |
|          |     arguments critiquing and/or supporting various        |
|          |     treatment methods designed to address mental health   |

| **Descr  | This course continues your psychology journey, as we      |

|          | relationship. This is a **discussion-based** course.      |
|          | Seminars are a cornerstone of this course. The point of   |
|          | them is to give you the opportunity to develop your       |
|          | ability to integrate different academic disciplines; they |
|          | also serve as the primary venue for expressing and        |
|          | discussing ideas with your peers. As you participate in   |
|          | the Seminars, I encourage you to work on honing the       |
|          | skills and confidence to effectively communicate your     |
|          | ideas. Together, we will consider issues that arouse in   |
|          | the courses, discuss the content, and prepare for the     |
|          | various seminar assignments. Throughout, I ask you to     |
|          | focus on the following main question: How do the          |
|          | interactions between disciplines open up new ways of      |
|          | understanding the world                                   |

| **Obje   | As you've already known, this is a discussion-based       |
| ctives** | seminar; attendance is mandatory and part of your seminar |
|          | grade. I expect you to engage in serious debate, deep     |
|          | thinking, and courteous dialogue because we believe it    |
|          | provides a productive foundation for understanding        |
|          | ourselves and our relationship with the society in which  |
|          | we live. [While]{.underline} [sometimes you have personal |

|          | In this course, together we will discuss your insights,   |
|          | questions, comments, and concerns. I expect you respond   |
|          | to your classmates with the respect that you yourself     |
|          | expect to receive. Since attendance is mandatory,         |
|          | unexcused absences will affect this component of your     |
|          | grade. If you anticipate missing class for any reason,    |
|          | make sure to discuss it with your instructor in advance.  |

|          | Finally, your participation grade includes your           |
|          | participation in the course more broadly: attending all   |
|          | lectures, participating in lectures via questions and     |
|          | comments, and meeting with the teaching team as necessary |
|          | (especially as you prepare your essays and work on essay  |
|          | improvement). I seek engagement across all components of  |

| **Descr  | A life worth living is worth living well, but what does   |
| iption** | it mean to "live well"? It is a question that has been    |
|          | asked by the greatest minds throughout history the world  |
|          | over, but it can only be answered by each of us as        |
|          | individuals. We are all made to answer this question in   |
|          | some form with every decision we make every day. What     |
|          | will I eat for lunch? How will I travel to school today?  |
|          | How will I react to this situation? Being mindful of this |
|          | allows us to live a purposeful, fulfilling life. In this  |
|          | class, we will examine perspectives ranging from Plato to |
|          | Rousseau, Lao Zi to Locke, in order to provide a          |
|          | framework for each of us to build our personal ethos.     |
|          | Selected readings detailing different points of view on   |
|          | this subject followed by peer-led discussions will form   |
|          | the foundation of this course. From there, we will begin  |
|          | asking how to apply our beliefs to our everyday lives.    |
|          | Ultimately, students will be asked to provide a personal  |
|          | statement outlining their most fundamental belief and how |
|          | it can be applied in their day to day lives. The goal is  |
|          | not to live by someone else's understanding of how we     |
|          | should live, but to understand how we live, why we live   |
|          | that way, and apply consistent action to our behavior     |
|          | according to what we discover about ourselves.            |

| **Descr  | The years between 1945 and the present in Europe are full |
| iption** | of change and contradiction. In 1945, Europe was in       |
|          | ruins, devastated by six years of fighting between its    |
|          | countries. Just decades later, it was experiencing        |
|          | unification through the European Union and trying to      |
|          | repair ties from the scars of history and Cold War        |
|          | standoffs. This course will use film, literature, poetry, |
|          | and historical sources to capture the formative moments   |
|          | of the post-1945 European world. Four main periods will   |
|          | be investigated in-depth: 1) post-War Europe, 2) Cold War |
|          | tensions, and 3) the fall of the USSR and the East Bloc,  |
|          | and 4) European unification and current tensions. **This  |
|          | course is an interdisciplinary course. That means that it |
|          | does not follow just one discipline but uses sources and  |
|          | methodologies from various disciplines to study Europe in |
|          | the 1945-present period.** Above all, this is a           |
|          | humanities course. We will use film studies, literary     |
|          | theory, philosophy, historical primary source analysis,   |
|          | cultural studies, art history and art critical theory,    |
|          | and psychology as we probe our material As we dig into    |
|          | the film, literature, and history of the period our       |
|          | essential questions are:                                  |
|          |                                                           |
|          | -   what are the large-scale changes and developments     |
|          |     that Europe saw in the second half of the 20^th^      |
|          |     century?                                              |

|          |                                                           |
|          | -   how can the stories and narratives in the film and    |
|          |     literature studied provide useful lessons about human |
|          |     behavior that are universal?                          |
|          |                                                           |
|          | -   how did Europeans try to make sense of the world that |
|          |     they lived in through 1945-present? what specific     |
|          |     tools or strategies did they use to convey their      |
|          |     message?                                              |
|          |                                                           |
|          | -   what modern-day parallels do we see in the art,       |
|          |     literature, film, and history of this period? are     |
|          |     there any similarities in human behavior, ideas of    |
|          |     power, principles of conformism or prejudice?         |

| **Descr  | This course continues your psychology journey, as we      |

|          | relationship. This is a **discussion-based** course.      |
|          | Seminars are a cornerstone of this course. The point of   |
|          | them is to give you the opportunity to develop your       |
|          | ability to integrate different academic disciplines; they |
|          | also serve as the primary venue for expressing and        |
|          | discussing ideas with your peers. As you participate in   |
|          | the Seminars, I encourage you to work on honing the       |
|          | skills and confidence to effectively communicate your     |
|          | ideas. Together, we will consider issues that arouse in   |
|          | the courses, discuss the content, and prepare for the     |
|          | various seminar assignments. Throughout, I ask you to     |
|          | focus on the following main question: How do the          |
|          | interactions between disciplines open up new ways of      |
|          | understanding the world around you?                       |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Obje   | As you've already known, this is a discussion-based       |
| ctives** | seminar; attendance is mandatory and part of your seminar |
|          | grade. I expect you to engage in serious debate, deep     |
|          | thinking, and courteous dialogue because we believe it    |
|          | provides a productive foundation for understanding        |
|          | ourselves and our relationship with the society in which  |
|          | we live. [While sometimes you]{.underline} [have personal |
|          | affairs and have to leave, if you miss a seminar, this is |
|          | not an excuse or guarantee that you will                  |
|          | receive]{.underline} [credit for the absence. You may be  |
|          | asked to do additional work or simply not have an         |

|          | In this course, together we will discuss your insights,   |
|          | questions, comments, and concerns. I expect you respond   |
|          | to your classmates with the respect that you yourself     |
|          | expect to receive. Since attendance is mandatory,         |
|          | unexcused absences will affect this component of your     |
|          | grade. If you anticipate missing class for any reason,    |
|          | make sure to discuss it with your                         |

| **Descr  | Over five hundred years ago, European ships set sail to   |
| iption** | plant the seeds of empire around the globe. In the        |
|          | subsequent centuries, their languages, religions,         |
|          | cultures, and political systems took root and spread to   |
|          | every continent through violence, manipulation, and       |
|          | oppression. In the post-war era, decolonization efforts   |
|          | have given rise to independent nations in the wake of     |
|          | these empires. But what sort of lasting fallout remains   |
|          | from centuries of colonialism? How can we better          |
|          | understand the modern world by understanding our recent   |
|          | past? This class will take a more scholarly approach to   |
|          | complex global issues that have arisen as a result of     |
|          | colonialism and imperialism. By examining both primary    |
|          | sources and modern academic literature, we seek to gain a |
|          | more complete perspective on the modern globalized world, |
|          | how we got here, and what our predecessors thought and    |
|          | experienced.                                              |

| **Descr  | Introduction to Microeconomics is a one-semester course   |
| iption** | that focuses on how economic decisions are made by        |
|          | individuals, firms, and organizational structures. Supply |
|          | and demand analysis is developed to demonstrate how       |
|          | market prices are determined, how those prices determine  |
|          | an economy\'s allocation of goods and services, how       |
|          | factors of production are allocated in the production     |
|          | process, and how goods and services are distributed       |
|          | throughout the economy. We evaluate the strengths and     |
|          | weaknesses of economic decision makers by using the       |
|          | concepts of efficiency and equity. We also analyze and    |
|          | evaluate the effects of government intervention. Emphasis |
|          | is placed on reasoned logical argument so that we can use |
|          | economics as a method and model for decision making.      |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Obje   | Students will study how various economic agents make      |
| ctives** | their choices and decisions in a market environment, and  |
|          | the implications of those choices and decisions for the   |
|          | allocation of productive resources. After successful      |
|          | completion of this course students will be able to        |
|          | demonstrate command of basic microeconomic concepts and   |
|          | graphical models, and apply them to new situations. In    |

|          | Growing up in cities, we imagine that nature only exists  |
|          | in rural areas or somewhere we cannot reach. We are       |
|          | isolating ourselves from the natural world around us and  |
|          | the environment we are protecting. However, nature is     |
|          | never far away from us. Even in the city, we are          |
|          | surrounded by life -- trees, grasses, insects, birds, and |
|          | mammals. If you are willing to look, you will see.        |
|          |                                                           |
|          | This course wants to bring students into the peaceful     |
|          | state of **natural observation** while improving their    |
|          | skills in nature mapping and understanding of the         |
|          | evolutionary view. The course will also be                |
|          | **text-based**: students are going to read the whole book |
|          | *The Forest Unseen* and several chapters in *Keeping a    |

|          | At the same time, this course will involve a **long-term  |
|          | field study**. Students will use mostly in-class time to  |
|          | go into the campus, choose a spot, observe, and take      |
|          | records. The in-door courses will involve lectures,       |
|          | discussions, and presentations. Students will also get to |
|          | know concepts in evolution such as the phylogenetic tree, |
|          | mutation, natural selection, coevolution, etc.            |

  **Course name**     Social and Literary Vision of Hip-Hop
  ------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  **Grade**           S2 & S3

  **Semester**        Fall

  **Pre-requisite**   None

  **Instructor**      Drake Ao (Alex Sicurella)

  **Description**     Hip-Hop started in 1970s at the hopeless streets of Bronx,
                      NY, when music instruments and education were scarce.
                      Started out as party music, hip-hop soon developed
                      conscious and started to serve as a type of stylistic
                      social commentary. Within 20 years, the urban subculture
                      which serves as voice of the confused black youths become
                      the crown jewels of pop culture. As hip-hop music gained
                      global popularity among the youth (in the form of trap and
                      new school), however, the history and reflection behind the
                      culture are rarely mentioned.

  **Objectives**      This course intends to give students an idea of the
                      development of hip hop as well as its social and cultural
                      significance. The content will not only include important
                      concepts and the beauty of hip-hop, but also its influence
                      to the world. In this course, student will examine
                      documentaries, primary sources (news stories & articles),
                      statistical chart to seek connections between the sounds of
                      old-school hip-hop music and the historical, social,
                      cultural conditions -- civil rights movement, the cold war,
                      Reaganomics... -- of US, especially in New York.
                      Furthermore, student will also examine the development of
                      Hip-Hop from an industrial perspective and complete
                      research a writing assignment. By taking this course,
                      students are expected to view the culture, music, business,
                      and even the society of the world we're living in through a
                      new lens.

Governance

**Grade** Senior 1, Senior 2, and Senior 3

**Semester** Fall

**Pre-requisite** Strong interest towards environmental study, public
health, and sociology

**Instructor** Xu Mingxuan, Zhang Zichen (Jackie Wheelock)

> The course *Environmental Issues in Public Health: Sociology and
> Governance* is an interdisciplinary course that allows students to
> learn information from multiple perspectives, including ecology,
> environmental sociology, public health, history, law and policy, and
> psychology. Public health is the science and the art of preventing
> disease,
>
> **Description** prolonging life, and promoting physical health. At the
> same time, it is hard to separate public health from environmental and
> social contexts, given that people, society, and the environment keep
> interacting. This course focuses on diverse types of environmental
> situations and social situations, poverty, pollution, inequality, and
> climate change, which could considerably influence people's health
> conditions and pandemics. Students will

-   Identify and describe multiple causes of different pandemics in
    history.

-   Understand and discuss the impact of poverty, pollution, inequality,
    and climate change on specific groups of

**Objectives** people and pandemics.

-   Learn the history, types, transmission mechanisms, causation, and
    impact of specific infectious diseases.

-   Compare the policy made before and after the pandemics.

-   Develop and design policies for the prevention of the fictional
    pandemic at the end of the course.
